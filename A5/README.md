# Assignment to introduce Prolog

When list is being passed in a main clause, none of the elements of list should be a variable.

-In problem 1, use the predicate as given in assigment.

-In problem 2, use the predicate as given in assigment.

-In problem 3, pass the list as argument of predicate, eg. `?- arith([1,2,3,4,5]).` The equation in printed in the standard output. A unary operator '+' or '-' is inserted before the first element. A binary operator '+', '-' or '=' is inserted between each pair of consecutive elements. '=' will be inserted between exactly one pair. Inserted operators are separated from elements of list using a space when printing. Use `;` to get the next solution.

-In problem 4, call the predicate `?- abcd()` to get the result. The result is printed in the standard output. The person who paddles twice is printed on the first line.  The crossings are printed in order from first to last. Each crossing is a list containing the people who cross with the paddler as the first element of the list. Lists of two elements denote crossings from left bank to right and lists of single element denote crossings from right bank to left.
Use `;` to get the next solution.
